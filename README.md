# Valgrind + ArinX

This is not [the canonical Valgrind Git
repository](https://sourceware.org/git/valgrind.git).

This is a working copy being used to develop
"[ArinX](https://github.com/EmmetCaulfield/valgrind/tree/master/arinx/)",
a plugin to compute arithmetic and other operational intensities.
